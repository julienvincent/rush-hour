Rushhour Game

# UI
Uncomplete

# Terminal output
Requires Java 8

Due to the fact that the UI is incomplete - running the program with a ui blocks running the solution file till the ui is closed. to get around this,
I hastily added a `--no-ui` flag you can tag on to just run in terminal

#### Usage:

[`$ cd build`]

`$ java rush/RushHour a/board a/solution [-,--options]`

##### Options:

+ `-d, --debug` - enable debug logs
+ `--no-ui` - disable the ui
